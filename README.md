# Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Credit Card Fraud Detection** is a machine learning project that aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression. The model is trained on a dataset containing transactions labeled as legitimate or fraudulent, allowing it to predict the likelihood of fraud for new transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud). It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To build a predictive model that can accurately classify credit card transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Techniques Used**: Logistic Regression, Data Preprocessing, Feature Scaling, Model Evaluation.
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating the machine learning model
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
